### nugscraper

The nugs.net live music provider has a bulk download tool for Windows and OSX, but none for Linux. I got tired of having to click "download" a ton of times, or use a third-party add-on like DownThemAll, so I decided to write a script to deal with it for me.  
`nugscraper` will also allow you to specify a pattern to use when naming downloaded files.
A tool to download files from nugs.net. Will only work with shows that you've purchased!

### usage

Invoke the tool by calling `nugscraper` from the command line. You'll need to copy and paste the link from a "download all" window for usage in this tool.

Options:  

--url [-u]          --  URL of the download all window  
--dest-dir [-d]     --  Destination directory
